# Computer Science Align Student Portfolio

## About Me
As a Computer Science Align student at Northeastern University, I am transitioning from an Economics background to the world of software development. My diverse educational background, combined with hands-on coding projects, has equipped me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and software design.

## Programming Languages
C, Python, Java

## Education
- **MS in Computer Science (Align Program)**, Northeastern University *(Current)*
- **BA in Economics**, University of California Irvine *(2020)*

## Projects

### Custom Hashmap Implementation in C
This project demonstrates my proficiency in low-level programming and algorithm design.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented a hashmap with O(1) average-time complexity for key operations (insertion, deletion, retrieval)
- Designed a custom hash function to optimize key distribution and minimize collisions
- Utilized linked lists for efficient collision resolution
- Implemented proper memory management techniques to prevent memory leaks


### Shortest Path Finder for Cities
This project showcases my understanding of graph theory and algorithm implementation in C

**Key Features:**
- Developed a program to find the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Implemented a graph data structure using adjacency lists
- Created functions to read city and distance data from files and dynamically build the graph
- Designed an efficient implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm with O((V + E) log V) time complexity

### Personal Finance Assistant (Python)
This project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming and financial data management.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented CRUD operations for financial transactions
- Designed a Transaction class to encapsulate financial data
- Created functions for loading and saving transactions to/from a file
- Implemented date validation and user input error handling
- Developed features to generate financial reports and filter transactions by date range

### Checkers Game Engine (Java)
This project showcases my proficiency in Java and game logic implementation.

**Key Features:**
- Developed a robust Checkers game engine using object-oriented principles
- Designed an abstract class (AbstractCheckersPiece) and interface (CheckersPiece) for flexible piece representation
- Created specialized classes for different piece types (Man and King)
- Implemented game rules and move validation logic for regular pieces and kings

**Technical Highlights:**
- Language: Java
- Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- Skills: Game State Management, Move Validation, Error Handling
